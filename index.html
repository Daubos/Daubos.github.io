        <h1>Edwin's Webpage</h1>
        
        <p>My name is Edwin Padua and I am a student at Academy of Urban Planning and Engineering. I am in 9th grade and about to be in 10th. Things I like to do on my free time is play video games, read and play my instruments. My favorite subject would probably be physics. Things that I want to persue in terms of work are being a professional violin concertist, marine biologist, or an architect.</p>
